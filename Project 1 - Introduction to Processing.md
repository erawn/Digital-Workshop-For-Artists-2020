## Project 1 - Introduction to Processing

This week you'll get confortable with Processing. If this is your first time programming, you'll probably spend your time getting
used to Java. If you've already programmed before, apply programming ideas you already know to make something really cool! 

Specifically, we'll make sure everyone has some bases covered:

- Variables
- If/Else Statements
- For/While Loops 

These three tools can make things of surprising complexity in Processing!
