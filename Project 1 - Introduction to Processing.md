# Project 1 - Introduction to Processing

The first three weeks you'll get confortable with Processing. If this is your first time programming, you'll probably spend your time getting used to Java. If you've already programmed before, apply programming ideas you already know to make something really cool! 

## Your Goal: Make 5 compositions. Some can be contiuations of a single idea but be sure to iterate and be flexible! Each should reflect unique development. 

Specifically, we'll make sure everyone has some bases covered:

- Variables
- If/Else Statements
- For/While Loops 
- Functions

These three tools can make things of surprising complexity in Processing! 
### If you are new to coding, be sure that you follow the tutorials below and make use of each of these tools in your code! 

Your first step will be to download [Processing](https://processing.org/download/). 
Then, download [helloWorld.pde](https://github.com/erawn/Digital-Workshop-For-Artists-2020/blob/master/helloWorld.pde) and open it up. Press the play button ![alt text](https://github.com/erawn/Digital-Workshop-For-Artists-2020/blob/master/ProcessingPlay.png "Processing Play Button") to run the code and you should see this:
![alt text](https://github.com/erawn/Digital-Workshop-For-Artists-2020/blob/master/HelloWorldCanvas.png "helloWorld Render")
Read through the comments (marked off with "//") next to each line. Try changing each number and running the code again and see what changed - do each of your changes make sense? 

Next, take a look at each of these examples:

- [Variables](http://learningprocessing.com/examples/chp04/example-04-02-usingvars#) and 
- [If/Else Statements](https://github.com/erawn/Digital-Workshop-For-Artists-2020/blob/master/p1Conditional.pde) and Video
- [For](http://learningprocessing.com/examples/chp06/example-06-06-forloop)/[While](http://learningprocessing.com/examples/chp06/example-06-03-whileloop) Loops 
- [Functions](http://learningprocessing.com/examples/chp07/example-07-02-calling-function)


If any part of these are confusing, you might find some of the below resources helpful: (you can also ask any questions in the Slack!)

- [Video Explanation of Variables](http://learningprocessing.com/videos/4-0)
- [Video Explanation of IF/Else Statements](http://learningprocessing.com/videos/5-1)
- [Video Explanation of For Loops](http://learningprocessing.com/videos/6-2)
- [Video Explanation of While Loops](http://learningprocessing.com/videos/6-0)
- [Video Explanation of Functions](http://learningprocessing.com/videos/7-1)


- [Video/Interactive tutorial to Processing](https://hello.processing.org/) (recommended for people new to coding!)

- [Explanation of Color In Processing](https://processing.org/tutorials/color/)

If there's ever a function you don't understand, you'll probably find in the [documentation here](https://processing.org/reference/).

Now- create! Try different shapes and parameters (find them in the documentation above), experiment with color and composition. Have fun! (it's the most important part). 

### Each week you'll post your progress. Due 4/24 in-Class.

## Deliverables
- 5 Compositions as image files and the corresponding code used to make those compositions in a ZIP folder. Send it to me as a private message on Slack. Post your favorite image or two in the slideshow for the week to show to the class.
