# Digital Workshop For Artists - Spring 2020

This accessible one-unit pass/fail introductory workshop class is designed for students who are
new to working with code and electronics, giving them the technical background necessary to
feel comfortable in digital studio classes such as Embodied Interfaces (162), Drawing with Code
(163), Making it With Arduino (130), and other Emerging Media courses. By teaching
introductory electronics and programming concepts specifically to be used in creative practice,
this workshop class will be an accessible introduction to using electronics in students' own
artistic endeavors. Students will learn to use code as a creative material, investigating digital 
interaction, data, and design with art. Through in-class discussions and guided independent work,
students will learn an actionable toolbox for creative practice with software interfaces, with a focus on building skills students
can use in their own work and in future classes.

## Class Layout
Due to the now online nature of the class, meeting times will be shortened to ~20min to focus on a short discussion of reading and a presentation of students' work so far. Therefore, most of the work will be up to you to complete whenever you'd like. The projects are designed to be very open-ended prompts to guide your exploration.

Through the week, support will be given in two ways. First, there is a large bank of resources, tutorials, and examples already on this site. If you're looking for ideas or looking for ways to extend your code, this is a good place to start. Second, we'll have a class Slack where everyone can post questions. Before asking a question, be sure to check if your question has already been asked! 

If you have question you'd like to ask individually, you can always message me on Slack or send me an email.

## Assignment Structure
Every week students will post a work update to (very) briefly discuss each meeting. In addition, there will be weekly reading assignments, usually with a small prompt to guide your thinking and occasionally a required response (no more than a few sentences).

## Course Plan 

Week 2 
  - Bring in one piece of art which you would call "Digital" Or "Electronic". Write a small paragraph on why you would and why this piece is interesting, engaging, or important (you'll deliver this in class out loud). To prompt our discussion, think about what digital art is and what it encompasses: is digital art different than other kinds of art? What does it mean to work with digital or electronic materials? What are those materials? 
  
**Add a photograph or video of your piece to the slidedeck before class.**
  
### Digital Materiality
Week 3
  - Abstracting Craft: The Practiced Digital Hand -- Malcom McCullough - Read up to "Appreciation", I've left the rest of the chapter in case you're interested. 
     <br>Prompt: "Acute knowledge of a medium's structure comes not by theory but through involvement." Look at Table 7.2 of "Continuous Operations". Let's add one more line: Programming- what is the "Continuous Process" at work here? How many different ways can you describe the *involvement* at play in programming as a creative medium? Two to Five Sentences. 

Week 4
  - [Olivia Jack Livecoding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cw7tPDrFIQg)
  - [Check out her performance too](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyEIDNtt9Hs)
   <br> Prompt: Jack presents Hydra as a digital art medium in a different paradigm to Processing. Summarize her point in one or two sentences, and then muse about the paradigm Processsing finds itself in: what kinds of assumptions does it make about who is making art and how they're making it? For what purpose? How is this different than the livecoding she presents? For ideas, take a look at her performance video and compare her experience of making art to yours in Processing. 

### Interaction, Design, and the Body

Week 5
 - What's the Use, Sarah Ahmed, 21-26
    <br>Prompt: Sarah Ahmed presents many ways in which use can operate in our lives. If we view interactive art as art *about* how people  use computers, what does Ahmed help us see about how computers can, should, or ought to be used? Pick one facet of use Ahmed describes and think about how it might apply to computers. Two to Five sentences.  
 
Week 6
  - The Design of Everyday Things, Don Norman, 10-19
    <br>Prompt: Art made with computers necessarily includes a background of design: norms and paradigms of how, where, and why we should interact with computers. What happens when we use Norman's language of affordances and signifiers to make art? How can the language of design be repurposed or investigated with digital art? Two to Five sentences. 
  
Week 7
  - Interactive Art and Embodiment, Nathaniel Stern, Excerpt (4 Pages)
    <br>Prompt: This is a shorter but more difficult reading, so to help guide your understanding please summarize the reading in a short paragraph. What is being argued here, and why does it matter? 

### Data 

Week 8
  - [Trevor Paglen - Six Landscapes](https://youtu.be/j56s46e97Lo)
    Watch the first 20min (although the whole talk is great!). 
    <br>Prompt: At first glance this might be a weird introduction to "Data", but Paglen is dealing with many kinds of data as a medium. How is data playing a role in his work? What are the political/artistic consequences of that data in his art? Two to Five Sentences.
  
Week 9 
  - Sorting Things Out: Classification and Its Consequences, Geoffrey Bowker and Susan Star, 33-40
    <br>Prompt: This reading discusses the many ways in which infrastructure operates to invisibly sustain norms. Give an example of how computers or digital infrastructure operates in such a way in your life. How could digital art be used to reveal or investigate that operation? Three to Five sentences. 

### Final Presentations!
Week 10
  - No Reading - Everyone will submit an image/video/audio/etc file to the slidedeck to show. We'll wrap up with a 
  summary and course reflection.
