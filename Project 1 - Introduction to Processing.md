# Project 1 - Introduction to Processing

The first three weeks you'll get confortable with Processing. If this is your first time programming, you'll probably spend your time getting used to Java. If you've already programmed before, apply programming ideas you already know to make something really cool! 

##Your Goal: Make 5 compositions. Some can be contiuations of a single idea but be sure to iterate and be flexible! Each should reflect unique development. 

Specifically, we'll make sure everyone has some bases covered:

- Variables
- If/Else Statements
- For/While Loops 
- Functions

These three tools can make things of surprising complexity in Processing! 
###If you are new to coding, be sure that you follow the tutorials below and make use of each of these tools in your code! 

Your first step will be to download [Processing](https://processing.org/download/). 
Then, download
