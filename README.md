# Digital Workshop For Artists - Spring 2020

This accessible one-unit pass/fail introductory workshop class is designed for students who are
new to working with code and electronics, giving them the technical background necessary to
feel comfortable in digital studio classes such as Embodied Interfaces (162), Drawing with Code
(163), Making it With Arduino (130), and other Emerging Media courses. By teaching
introductory electronics and programming concepts specifically to be used in creative practice,
this workshop class will be an accessible introduction to using electronics in students' own
artistic endeavors. Students will learn to program LED strips, read sensors with Arduino, learn to
code in Processing, and become familiar with a pipeline to connect all three. Through hands-on
demonstrations and creative exploration in class, students will learn an actionable toolbox for
creative practice with electronics and software interfaces, with a focus on building skills students
can use in their own work and in future classes.

Class Layout
Due to the now online nature of the class, meeting times will be shortened to ~20min to focus on a short discussion of reading and a presentation of students' work so far. Therefore, most of the work will be up to you to complete whenever you'd like. The projects are designed to be very open-ended prompts to guide your exploration.

Through the week, support will be given in two ways. First, there is a large bank of resources, tutorials, and examples already on this site. If you're looking for ideas or looking for ways to extend your code, this is a good place to start. Second, we'll have a class Slack where everyone can post questions. Before asking a question, be sure to check if your question has already been asked! 

If you have question you'd like to ask individually, you can always message me on Slack or send me an email.

## Reading

Every week there will be a short assignment, either a reading assignment, a talk, or an art search, where you'll find a piece of art and present (very briefly, as in a small paragraph) on why you think it's interesting. 

## Course Plan 

Week 2 
  - Bring in one piece of art which you would call "Digital" Or "Electronic". Write a small paragraph on why you would and why this piece is interesting, engaging, or important (you'll deliver this in class out loud). To prompt our discussion, think about what digital art is and what it encompasses: is digital art different than other kinds of art? What does it mean to work with digital or electronic materials? What are those materials? 
  
  Add a photograph or video of your piece to the class slidedeck here: ------- by the beginning of class.
