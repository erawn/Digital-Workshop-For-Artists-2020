# Digital-Workshop-For-Artists-2020

This accessible one-unit pass/fail introductory workshop class is designed for students who are
new to working with code and electronics, giving them the technical background necessary to
feel comfortable in digital studio classes such as Embodied Interfaces (162), Drawing with Code
(163), Making it With Arduino (130), and other Emerging Media courses. By teaching
introductory electronics and programming concepts specifically to be used in creative practice,
this workshop class will be an accessible introduction to using electronics in students' own
artistic endeavors. Students will learn to program LED strips, read sensors with Arduino, learn to
code in Processing, and become familiar with a pipeline to connect all three. Through hands-on
demonstrations and creative exploration in class, students will learn an actionable toolbox for
creative practice with electronics and software interfaces, with a focus on building skills students
can use in their own work and in future classes.
