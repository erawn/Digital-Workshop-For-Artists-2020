# Project 2 - Interaction

Computers sense their world around them through a myriad of inputs. In this project you'll explore one of those inputs by creating a piece in Processing. 

### Deliverable
Create an interactive work in Processing. Record a video of the work along with the input (camera feed, audio input, etc) and post it to the slidedeck. Zip your code and the video together and send it to me as a private Slack message.
