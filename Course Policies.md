## Attendance and Grading

This class is designed to be pressure-free, which means that completion of the assignments will be the only measure for grading. However, this class only meets a total of 10 times during the quarter. As a result, two **unexcused** absences will result in not receiving credit and not passing this class. Because of ongoing circumstances, I completely understand if your situation may be unstable or prevent you from engaging with this class for the same amount each week. Therefore, I only ask that you communicate with me early and often, and I promise we can work something out. This class should not add any stress!

## Honor Code and Fundamental Standard

It is expected that both Stanfordâ€™s Honor Code and Fundamental Standard will be followed in all matters relating to this course. https://communitystandards.stanford.edu/student-conduct-process/honor-code-and-fundamental-standard

## Students with Documented Disabilities
Students who may need an academic accommodation based on the impact of a disability must initiate the request with the Office of Accessible Education (OAE). Professional staff will evaluate the request with required documentation, recommend reasonable accommodations, and prepare an Accommodation Letter for faculty dated in the current quarter in which the request is being made. Students should contact the OAE as soon as possible since timely notice is needed to coordinate accommodations. The OAE is located at 563 Salvatierra Walk (phone: 723-1066, URL: http://studentaffairs.stanford.edu/oae).

In addition, please don't hesitate to email me at erawn@stanford.edu if you have any concerns. I will do everything in my power to ensure this class is as accessible as possible.
